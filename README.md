# Moody Player ðŸŽµðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¡

A full-stack project for learning how to integrate a backend with a frontend, featuring a "Moody Player" that detects your mood using your camera and recommends songs based on your facial expressions.

---

## Project Overview

**Moody Player** is a learning project that demonstrates:
- How to connect a React frontend with an Express backend
- Using face-api.js to detect user mood via webcam
- Storing and fetching songs from a backend based on detected mood

---

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Uses your webcam to analyze your facial expression.
- **Mood Recognition:** Detects moods like happy, sad, angry, etc.
- **Song Recommendation:** Fetches and displays songs matching your current mood.
- **Full Stack Integration:** Shows how frontend and backend communicate in a real-world app.

```

## How It Works

1. **User opens the app** and allows camera access.
2. **FaceDetection component** uses face-api.js to analyze the user's face.
3. **Mood is detected** (e.g., happy, sad, angry).
4. **Frontend sends a request** to the backend with the detected mood.
5. **Backend responds** with a list of songs matching that mood.
6. **Songs are displayed** for the user to play.
